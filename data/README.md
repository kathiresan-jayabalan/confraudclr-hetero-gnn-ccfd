# Dataset Instructions

We use the public **Credit Card Fraud Detection** dataset (European card transactions, anonymized features) available at:  
[Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) *(subject to Kaggle terms of use)*

## Usage

**Full dataset**:  
Download `creditcard.csv` from Kaggle and place it in this `data/` directory: data/creditcard.csv

**Sample data**:  
Use `creditcard.csv` (included as sample in repo) for testing the notebook without downloading the full dataset.

## Setup

1. Download dataset from Kaggle (or use sample data).
2. Place `creditcard.csv` in `data/` folder.
3. **Update notebook path** if needed (currently expects `/content/drive/MyDrive/credit card /creditcard.csv` in Colab).

**Note**: Sample data allows pipeline testing but **will not reproduce exact paper results**.
